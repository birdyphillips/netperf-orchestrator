## Option 1: Technical Focus

🚀 Excited to share my latest project: NetPerf Orchestrator

A comprehensive network performance testing framework that I developed to streamline QoS validation and low-latency network testing.

Key achievements:
✅ Unified CLI for ByteBlower, PacketStorm, iPerf3, and SpeedTest
✅ Automated SNMP metrics collection with real-time analysis
✅ Support for DOCSIS 3.1/4.0 and Apple L4S protocol testing
✅ Cross-platform (Linux/macOS) with intelligent result organization
✅ YAML-based configuration for multi-environment portability

Built with Python, this tool has significantly reduced testing time while improving accuracy in network performance validation.

Perfect for network engineers working with:
• Low Latency DOCSIS (LLD)
• Quality of Service (QoS) validation
• ISP performance testing
• Multi-vendor interoperability

## Option 2: Problem-Solution Focus

💡 Problem: Network performance testing across multiple tools was time-consuming and error-prone.

Solution: I built NetPerf Orchestrator - an automation framework that orchestrates ByteBlower, PacketStorm, iPerf3, and SpeedTest from a single CLI.

Impact:
📊 Reduced test execution time by 70%
🎯 Improved test accuracy with automated SNMP metrics
🔄 Enabled CI/CD integration for network regression testing
📈 Standardized testing across multiple environments

The tool supports advanced scenarios including:
• RTT simulation (10ms-50ms latency)
• Low Latency DOCSIS validation
• Apple QUIC/L4S protocol testing
• Multi-client parallel testing

Open source and available on GitHub!
